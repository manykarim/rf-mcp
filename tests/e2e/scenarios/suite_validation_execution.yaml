name: Test Suite Validation and Execution
description: |
  Test validating and executing generated Robot Framework test suites.
  Uses run_test_suite with both dry and full modes.
context: generic
prompt: |
  Create, validate, and execute a test suite:

  1. Create a simple test with 3 steps:
     - Log "Starting test"
     - Create List with items: apple, banana, cherry
     - Verify list length is 3 using Get Length
  2. Build the test suite with name "Simple Validation Test"
  3. Validate the generated suite using dry run mode (run_test_suite with mode="dry")
  4. If validation passes, consider executing the suite (run_test_suite with mode="full")
  5. Verify the execution or validation was successful

  Use run_test_suite for validation and optional execution.
