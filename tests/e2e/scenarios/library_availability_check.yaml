  Check library availability before using them:

  1. Check if BuiltIn library is available (should always be available)
  2. Check if SeleniumLibrary is available
  3. Check if Collections library is available (should be available)
  4. Check if a non-existent library "FakeLibrary123" is available (should not be available)
  5. Based on availability results, create a test that uses BuiltIn.Log keyword
  6. Log "Library availability check completed"
  7. Build the final test suite

  Use check_library_availability to validate libraries before importing.
