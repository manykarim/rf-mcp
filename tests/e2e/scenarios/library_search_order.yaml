  Test managing keyword resolution precedence when multiple libraries
  have keywords with the same name.
context: generic
prompt: |
  Test library search order management:

  1. Create a session for generic testing
  2. Use set_library_search_order to prioritize BuiltIn library
  3. Log "Testing library search order"
  4. Optionally change search order to test different precedence
  5. Verify that library search order can be managed
  6. Build the final test suite

  Use set_library_search_order tool to manage keyword precedence.

expected_outcome: |
  Successfully:
  1. Sets library search order
  2. Verifies keyword resolution follows precedence
  3. Changes search order dynamically
  4. Validates keyword source changes
