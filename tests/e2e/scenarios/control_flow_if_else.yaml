description: |
  Test IF/ELSE execution with execute_flow tool.
  Validates conditional branching based on variable values.
context: generic
prompt: |
  Create a test that demonstrates IF/ELSE usage:

  1. Set a variable AGE to 25
  2. Use IF/ELSE to check if AGE >= 18
     - IF TRUE: Log "Adult - can vote"
     - ELSE: Log "Minor - cannot vote"
  3. Set TEMPERATURE to 15
  4. Use IF/ELSE to check if TEMPERATURE > 20
     - IF TRUE: Log "Warm weather"
     - ELSE: Log "Cold weather - wear jacket"

  Use execute_flow for IF/ELSE implementation.
  Build the final test suite afterwards.

expected_outcome: |
  Successfully creates a test with IF/ELSE that:
  1. Evaluates conditional expressions
  2. Executes THEN branch when condition is true
  3. Executes ELSE branch when condition is false
  4. Validates correct branching behavior
